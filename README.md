# Different population trajectories of two reef-building corals with similar life-history traits

---

### Description:
This study investigated demographic processes of two coral species over 3 years to parametrize integral projection models, which estimated population growth rates and the likely trajectories of the coral populations into the near future. The findings demonstrate that coral species possessing similar life-history traits and growth morphologies, and which are generally regarded as ‘stress-tolerant’ species, may have contrasting trajectories because of subtle differences in demographic processes. Importantly, such approaches, which are capable of detecting subtle species-specific differences and predicting population trends, can provide early warning signs of population decline before major coral loss becomes evident.
